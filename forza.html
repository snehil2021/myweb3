        <h1>Forza Horison 5</h1>
        Forza Horizon 5 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in Mexico.[3] The game has the largest map in the entire Forza Horizon series, being 50% larger than Forza Horizon 4 while also having the highest point in the Horizon series.[4][5] The map was described by creative director Mike Brown as one of the most diverse Forza Horizon maps the team has built.[6] The map contains areas like an active caldera volcano, jungles and beaches, ancient Mayan temples, and cities such as Guanajuato. Players can explore the open world freely, though they can also compete in multiplayer races and complete the campaign mode. Both the cars featured in the game and the player character can be extensively customised.[7] The game is the first in the franchise to support ray tracing on cars (although this is only available in ForzaVista).

        The game introduces a new weather system (local weather) in which players can visit one side of the map and can visibly see a storm. Because Mexico is such a vast nation with such a wide range of elevations, multiple climates would appear in the game at around the same time. The four seasons still exist but would affect the eleven unique biomes around the map. For example, in the dry season, dust storms will appear, while tropical storms occur throughout the fall storm season.[9] Another detail is in the jungle, in which the environment would now react to the weather; an example of this is leaves flying everywhere.
        
        It also introduces a brand new Horizon Arcade. This consists of a series of mini-multiplayer games strewn across the map. One of these mini-multiplayer games is "Piñata pop" where the Horizon Festival's cargo plane drops piñatas. The goal is to pop as many piñatas as they can with the help of other players. It also introduces the "EventLab", a toolset in which players can create custom games, races, and more depending on their personal preference.[12] A new feature called "Forza Link" was introduced. According to Brown, it is an AI assistant that tracks the current statuses of players, helping them to link with other players online and play together. Forza Link can also link players' GPS systems if they accept the invitation from another player.
