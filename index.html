                Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar
                Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto
                IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on
                Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De
                Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts
                to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open
                world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los
                Santos, based on Los Angeles.

                <h1>PUBG</h1>
                PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (also known as PUBG: Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale
                game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole. The game is based on
                previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000
                Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In
                the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to
                kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map
                decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The
                last player or team standing wins the round.
