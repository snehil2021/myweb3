        <h1>Battlefield 2042</h1>
        Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 2042 is a multiplayer-focused first-person shooter. As the game is set in the near future, it features futuristic weapons and gadgets like deployable turrets and drones, as well as vehicles that players can commandeer.[1] Players can now request a vehicle air-drop to any location.[2] The game also introduces a new "Plus" system which allows players to customize their weapons on the spot. The class system was significantly overhauled. Players can assume control of a specialist who falls under the four traditional Battlefield gameplay classes of Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. These characters can wield all the weapons and gadgets players have unlocked. Each operator has their own unique skills and gadgets. For instance, one of the specialists is equipped with a wingsuit, while another is equipped with a healing pistol.[3] The game will launch with 10 specialists. Levolution and destructive environments from Battlefield 4 will return, and extreme weather effects such as tornadoes and sandstorms, which can lift players into a vortex and drastically reduce the visibility respectively, will also be present in Battlefield 2042.[4] The game will feature seven maps at launch. <br> <br>

The game has three main gameplay modes. "All-Out Warfare" encompasses "Breakthrough" and "Conquest", two staple modes of the series. In Conquest, two teams combat against each other to capture control points; once control points in a sector are captured, the team will control said sector. In Breakthrough, one team must try to capture another team's control points, while another team must defend them.[6] Both modes can be played with and against artificial intelligence.[7] The PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and Series S versions support 128 players, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One versions only support 64 players.[8] Other modes included in the game are a cooperative multiplayer mode called Hazard Zone, and a community-driven platform called Battlefield Portal. Portal allows players to create customized multiplayer modes and features select maps from past Battlefield games. In addition, players will be able to modify core gameplay elements such as health, weapon loadouts, and movement through a web-based scripting application. <br><br>

For the first time in the series, Battlefield 2042 will feature support for cross-platform play with the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S versions, while players of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions will be restricted to only those playing on the aforementioned platforms.
